Hello, can we please archive spdplyr? 

https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spdplyr 

The goals it had are no longer relevant, no one is using it as far as I can tell and there are better alternatives, it will be difficult to update it to work going forward, and there's a hard deadline on the current version when {maptools} is retired later this year. 

Thanks so much. 

Cheers, Mike


Was done same day.
