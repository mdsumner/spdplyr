# spdplyr

`spdplyr` provides methods for the `dplyr` verbs for the `Spatial` classes in the `sp` package. 


## Installation

Install from CRAN: 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("spdplyr")
```

The development version of `spdplyr` can be installed directly from Github: 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mdsumner/spdplyr")
```


# dplyr verbs for Spatial

Apply `dplyr` verbs to the attribute data of `sp` objects with dplyr verbs. 

See `?dplyr-Spatial'` for supported verbs. 


## How does it work? 

Most of it is easy, simply applying the analogous operation of the verb to the Spatial*DataFrame and subsetting/re-organizing as necessary. Some operations use the `spbabel::sptable` approach which provides a loss-less way to do what `ggplot2::fortify` does and its reverse. 


# Issues


**NOTE:** joins aren't really supported. See `sf` for better joins, and perhaps for a better option than this package. I've moved on from this quite a bit and am looking for a better design than simple features can provide.
